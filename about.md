## ABOUT

I am a undergraduate student of **Mechatronics Engineering**. I chose this major because I always loved to know how the things are made and how they work. I am passionate about technology - from its structure to how it changes the world. Nowadays I have a special interest in **Control systems** , **Blockchain**, **Data Science**, **Machine Learning** and **Biomedical Engineering** . I am experienced with **SolidWorks**, **C**, **C++**, **R**, **Python**, **Matlab** and **Assembly** (x86 and MIPS). You can check some of my works in [GitHub](https://github.com/vitorduarte).

I also enjoy working with **Design**, **Illustration** and **Video Editing** . I have produced some works within those areas and it is possible to check some of them in my Portfolio or my [Behance](https://www.behance.net/vitoralvescfb0). I create with **Adobe Illustration**, **Photoshop**, **Premiere** and **After Effects**
