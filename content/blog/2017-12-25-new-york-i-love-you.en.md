The TV Show Master of Node came into thesecond season with huge approval. With the intent to tell the history of Dev (Aziz Ansari), this production goes beyond a simple narrative about the life of a comedian and actor to become a narrative about life. The sixth episode of the second season “New York, I Love You” make it clear.

Every metropolis has a clear stereotype associated with it, surrounded by common sense. This happens in Tokyo, in São Paulo and this happens in New York too. This image, in fact, is real but it shows only a small part of what the city really is, on its nuances, particularities, and suburbs.

And the most important thing, **a city is made by people**. I truly believe that this sentence is a synthesis of this episode. In this story, written by Cord Jefferson, the Dev's life and conflicts were kept out of the screen to tell the story of a few people.

A crucial part of the narrative is the fact that the characters depicted were in general marginalized, mostly because of their professional positions. With a busy life, these people tend to be ignored. This episode shows a bit about the life of a doorman, a shop cashier. and a taxi driver. Of course, they aren't their professions, they are Eddie ([Frank Harts](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1320715/?ref_=tt_cl_t4)), Maya ([Treshelle Edmond](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3439043/?ref_=tt_cl_t10)) e Samuel ([Enock Ntekereze](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm8988145/?ref_=tt_cl_t13)). They are ordinary people, living their lives without glamour, but amazingly. In an immersive narrative, the characters are shown fluidly in a sequence, keeping the spectator focused on the story. Besides that, a small detail on the second act brings to us a strange sensation, and after that a reflection. When Maya is on screen, the audio is off, putting the spectator in the skin of the woman, who is deaf. Everything showed with humor, unstereotyped and real.

With this exposition of a small part of the quotidian of these people, it is possible to understand a lot about their lives, their relationships, and their relation with the city. Going from the interaction with the space to the interaction with the city as a group of persons. The characters are so real, so believable that becomes easy to put ourselves in their place. Achieving an intimate relationship with them. With a sublime story, this episode became one of my favorite episodes, a particular jewel of a Tv Show which is a diamond mine.
