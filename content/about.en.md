I am a Blockchain Developer, I've been working with software development since 2017. I am passionate about technology - from its structure to how it changes the world. This passion came because of my curiosity, I always loved to know how the things are made and how they work, now I build things too! Nowadays I have a special interest in **Control systems** , **Blockchain**, **Machine Learning** and **Biomedical Engineering** . I am experienced with **Typescript**, **Javascript**, **Nodejs**, **Python**, **Go**, **Docker** and **Kubernetes**. You can check some of my works in [GitHub](https://github.com/vitorduarte).
